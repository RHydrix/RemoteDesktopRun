# RemoteDesktopRun
Batch File to enable remote desktop

These Files are to quickly and easily enable remote desktop on a computer or laptop

RDRun pulls up a bunch of text in the first line you should see "AllowRemoteRPC",
if it is set to 0x0 it is enabled if it is set to 0x1 it is not enabled then typing "y" or "n" will either 
quit or change that value to 0x0.

if "y" is chosen it will automatically reboot

RDRun-Fast does what the one above does but does not display any information and automatically enables it and reboots
